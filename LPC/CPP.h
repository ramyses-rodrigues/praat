/* 
	Cepstral Peak Prominence is a measure that shows periodicity in the Spectrum.
	The peak prominenceis the distance between top of the first peak in the PowerCepstrum
	and the peak's background.
	Periodicity in the Spectrum is caused by periodicity in the sound if the
	sound is composed of multiple harmonics. A single sine with frequency f0 does not show 
	periodicity in the spectrum, just a single peak. Only if there are harmonics of f0,
	periodicity in the spectrum will turn up. 
	
	Attributes:
		xmin			// Start time (seconds).
		xmax > xmin		// End time (seconds).
		nx >= 1			// Number of time slices.
		dx > 0.0		// Time step (seconds).
		x1				// Centre of first time slice (seconds).
		ymin, ymax, dy, y1 = 1.0
		ny = 1
		z [1] [1..nt]
		TODO
			The Cepstral Prominence Peak value, a real number between 0 dB and > 100 dB:
			0 dB means no periodicity at all
			Normal values for speech are between 10 dB for non-voiced parts and 60 dB for monotone perfectly voiced
